            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Eddie Van Halen's life:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>1955</strong> - Eddie Van Halen born in January 26, in Nijmegen, Netherlands</li>

                <li><strong>1961</strong> - Van Halen and his older brother, Alex, learned to play the piano as
                    children starting at the age of six.The brothers commuted from Pasadena to San Pedro to study
                    with an elderly man, Stasys (Stanley) Kalvaitis who taught them classical piano. Van Halen and
                    brother Alex hated the commute, but continued as their mother would discipline them if they
                    refused to go.</li>

                <li><strong>1972</strong> - Van Halen formed another band, originally called "Genesis." The name was
                    changed to "Mammoth" when Van Halen became aware of the English progressive rock band Genesis.
                    Mammoth consisted of Van Halen on guitar and lead vocals, his brother Alex on drums and bassist
                    Mark Stone.</li>

                <li><strong>1976</strong> - At one point, the group considered using the name "Rat Salad," after the
                    Black Sabbath song of the same name, before settling on "Van Halen."The band originally began
                    playing cover material, ranging from pop to disco, before settling on original material. In
                    1976, band supporter Rodney Bingenheimer invited Kiss bassist Gene Simmons to check out a Van
                    Halen show.
                </li>

                <li><strong>1978</strong> - Van Halen is the debut studio album by American rock band Van Halen.
                    Released on February 10, 1978, the album peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album
                    became widely recognized as the band's popularity grew, selling more than ten million copies in
                    the United States by 1999 and achieving RIAA diamond status.

                <p>"Van Halen changed the way electric guitarists played, the sounds they strove for, even the
                    physical construction of the instruments they used, with multiple patents to his name (and other
                    technical breakthroughs, he credibly maintained, that were ripped off and capitalized upon
                    before he learned how to use the patent office). He single-handedly gave the electric guitar an
                    extra decade or more of cultural prominence, even as heâ€™d try to duck blame for a generation of
                    teased-hair shredders who played like typewriters." </p>
